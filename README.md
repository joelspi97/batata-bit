# BatataBit
This is a project made just for fun and practice.

BatataBit is a generic crypto currency website. It consists of a fully responsive static layout that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

To build it I used:
* HTML5
* Sass

I don't claim ownership for any of the images.
